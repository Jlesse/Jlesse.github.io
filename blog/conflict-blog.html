    I used to live in condo apartment with a friend of mine. We had been friends a long time and he owned the condo, so he was giving me discount. I moved into the spare room, and for a while things were not bad.

  <p>
    At that time I was regularly working 60+ hour weeks so I wasn't doing much at home but sleeping and sometimes eating a late dinner. At first, the apartment was pretty clean and dishes were usually washed within a day. It was nice to come home to clean space and be able to use a plate, or have a clean bowl to eat cereal with in the morning. But as time went on, my roommate started to care less about keeping up appearances. I am not a neat freak or anything, but I think its important when you share a space with someone to at least keep at nice for the other person. It irritated me that I was paying rent to someone who was actively making my living space a less desirable place to live.

    I didn't confront him about it, and I thought I would give him sometime to clean up an pull it together. He had recently gone though a bad break up from a long term relationship he had been in, so I understood that he was probably feeling depressed and not all that motivated, and I didn't want to be to critical. But it just got worse and worse. I came home late one night after work to a totally trashed apartment. I had drank a couple after shift drinks and angrily washed the mountain of dishes. My roommate was sleeping, but I made sure to wash them loudly so that he could hear me. Looking back on it, this was definitely not the correct way to deal with the situation. I think I had just repressed all of my feelings into a passive aggressive state.

    The next morning he confronted me about washing the dishes so late and loudly. I think I said something along the lines of "Someones gotta do it...". Which upset him, and he said I was being an asshole. I left for work and felt kind of bad about being rude, but also still angry at him for not doing his fair share around the house. when I got home that night I decided to just be straight up with him about how I felt. I told him "My girlfriend is coming into town for a couple weeks and WE really need to clean up this weekend. I think everyone would both feel a lot better if the house were clean. lets pick a day and time to do it". I think by helping him and encouraging him to clean, I was finally able to get him to do it. After cleaning the house he agreed that it felt better to live in a clean space, and that its better to have the apartment clean if he is going to start dating again. We developed a routine and cleaned together every weekend, which actually turned out to be pretty fun. We listened to music and talked while cleaning house.

    I realized a couple things through this conflict. If all you do is wait for someone to behave the way you want them to, it will probably never happen. Its also bad to not be direct because you just repress feelings, which makes them worse. If you tell someone to do something, or not to do something, with an accusatory tone they will not be positively responsive. I think if you offer to help people and you shift some of the burden onto yourself, it puts you on the same team, and people will be more responsive to what you are asking them to do.
