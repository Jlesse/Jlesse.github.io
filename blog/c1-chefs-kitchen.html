      I am really excited to be a part of dev Bootcamp. The part where Shereef talks about the creative mindset vs. the consumer mindset really resonated with me. As person who enjoys creative tasks (music, art), and has literally worked a lot in kitchen, I have noticed these mindsets as well. I think its good to work on a team to create things together instead of passively consuming. As creator of things, you have so much more freedom to impact how things are done and their outcome, as opposed to a consumer who can only receive and either approve or disapprove. I am really looking forward to getting to know all of my cohort mates and collaborate. The more I become immersed in Dev Bootcamp, the more I find that the culture really resonates with me.

      Phase 0 is not a whole lot like I thought it would be. I thought it would start off quite a bit easier than its been based on what the code academy ruby track was like. I feel like I have kind been thrown right into the fire, and its been a struggle, but I think that its good because I am learning lot, and Dev Bootcamp provides lots of office hours and good resources to help us through it.

      I am really excited to be learning so much so quickly already. But it makes me really nervous. I have had a lot of trouble time boxing, and keeping things within a manageable time range. I feel like I keep getting sucked down rabbit holes, and dig too deep, or little errors happen and I have to spend a lot of time figuring them out and fixing them, or I have difficulty understanding something and I need it explained to me 3 different ways, or I over think reflections and write for too long. I am also worried that my writing style is not up to par, and that people might negatively review my reflections.

      All in all I think it will be really good for me though, and hopefully a lot of fun as well. I just have to reach out for help when I need it, and not be afraid of being confused and asking questions. We are all learning here together, and the more supportive of each other we are, and the more open we are, the more successful we all be in learning the material and making it through.
