<!--               REFLECTION
=============================================================
How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?

It was fun to wireframe with Marvy. She was really nice end helpful.
 It was interesting making design decisions as a team and sort
 negotiating what we wanted. I learned a few things from her, like
 flat layout web design, which I had not heard of before.

wireframing was helpful in the development process. It gave us an
easy reference to look at when putting the page together. We
already knew more or less what we wanted out the page, even though
the wireframe was very basic. I thought we made a pretty good
wireframe and incorporated most of the aspects more or less
decently into the blog template. I learned about the main element,
and made use of header and footer. we ended up using some internal
CSS to get things where we wanted them and to get them to look like
we wanted. I think we may have gotten a little carried and away
because it took quite a while. I am not sure if we were meant to
use CSS at this point, but I didn't really see another way to get
the the template to look anything like the wireframe without it. -->
